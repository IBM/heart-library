Welcome to HEART-library's documentation!
=========================================

HEART is a Python extension library for Machine Learning Security that builds on the popular Adversarial Robustness algorithms in `ART <https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox>`_.

The extension library is operation-ready and tailored for real-world DoD use cases, offering essential adversarial robustness methods within the three evaluation tool dimensions: physical realizability, perturbation type, black/white box. HEART allows the user to leverage core ART algorithms, while providing additional benefits to the AI Test & Evaluation (T&E) engineer:

-	Support for T&E of models for DoD use cases (developers, researchers and evaluators focused on adversarial machine learning capabilities)
-	Alignment to MAITE protocols to access this subset of ART and other JATIC tools for seamless T&E workflows
-	Essential subset of adversarial robustness methods for targeted AI security coverage
-	Assessment quality assurance in the form of metadata
-	In-depth support for users in the form of guides and examples
-	Front-end application for low-code users: `HEART Gradio Application <https://huggingface.co/spaces/CDAO/HEART-Gradio>`_

Our extension is operation-ready for real-world DoD use cases, offering essential AR methods within the three evaluation tool dimensions: physical realizability, perturbation type, black/white box.
