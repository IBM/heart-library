```

If conda is not currently installed on your devices, instructions to do so can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)

IBM has published a catalog of notebooks designed to assist developers of all skill levels with the process of getting started utilizing HEART in their AI T&E workflows. These Jupyter notebooks can be accessed within the official heart-library GitHub repository: [https://github.com/IBM/heart-library/tree/main/notebooks](https://github.com/IBM/heart-library/tree/main/notebooks)
