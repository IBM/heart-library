# Welcome to HEART-library's documentation!

HEART is a Python extension library for Machine Learning Security that builds on the popular Adversarial Robustness algorithms in [ART](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox).

The extension library is operation-ready and tailored for real-world DoD use cases, offering essential adversarial robustness methods within the three evaluation tool dimensions: physical realizability, perturbation type, black/white box. HEART allows the user to leverage core ART algorithms, while providing additional benefits to the AI Test & Evaluation (T&E) engineer:

- Support for T&E of models for DoD use cases (developers, researchers and evaluators focused on adversarial machine learning capabilities)
- Alignment to MAITE protocols to access this subset of ART and other JATIC tools for seamless T&E workflows
- Essential subset of adversarial robustness methods for targeted AI security coverage
- Assessment quality assurance in the form of metadata
- In-depth support for users in the form of guides and examples
- Front-end application for low-code users: [HEART Gradio Application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CDAO/HEART-Gradio)

Our extension is operation-ready for real-world DoD use cases, offering essential AR methods within the three evaluation tool dimensions: physical realizability, perturbation type, black/white box.
