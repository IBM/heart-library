# Welcome to HEART documentation!

HEART is an open-source python library that provides AI developers and researchers with testing and evaluation (T&E) tools to assess AI model performance under adversarial attacks and improve model resiliency. HEART builds on the popular AI Security and Adversarial Robustness algorithms in [ART](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox).

The extension library is operation-ready and tailored for real-world DoD use cases, offering essential adversarial robustness methods within the three evaluation tool dimensions: physical realizability, perturbation type, black/white box. To start evaluating your modelâ€™s AI Security robustness, refer to the resources below!
