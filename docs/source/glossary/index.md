=========



**Accuracy:** items correct out of total items tested, used to evaluate classification models

  **Accuracy, clean:** standard accuracy, before adversarial attack

  **Accuracy, robust:** accuracy after adversarial attack on all samples

  **Accuracy, adversarial:** accuracy after adversarial attack on samples correctly predicted in non-adversarial scenario

**Adversarial perturbation size:** usually defined by the norm of the perturbation matrix

**mAP (mean average precision):** used to evaluate object detection models (calculated difference between ground truth and prediction boxes)
