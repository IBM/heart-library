# Notebooks

HEART Library Notebooks can be found on [github](https://github.com/IBM/heart-library/tree/main/notebooks). Notebooks beginning with ‘get_started’ are for all T&E users and are a great place to start.

## `0_get_started_heart.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook demonstrates how to get started with HEART
>
> **Intended Audience:** All T&E users

## `1_get_started_pgd_attack.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook quickly demonstrates the use of the Projected Gradient Descent attack in code as part of Test & Evaluation of small benchmark datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Key features:
>
> - Attacks are demonstrated using parallel and non-parallel mode.
> - Extracting attack metadata to determine the best performing attacks.
> - Calculating clean and robust accuracy
> - Calculating perturbation
>
> **Intended Audience:** All T&E users

## `2_get_started_auto_attack.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook quickly demonstrates the use of AutoAttack in code as part of Test & Evaluation of small benchmark datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Key features:
>
> - Attacks are demonstrated using parallel and non-parallel mode.
> - Extracting attack metadata to determine the best performing attacks.
> - Calculating clean and robust accuracy
> - Calculating perturbation
>
> **Intended Audience:** Advanced T&E users

## `3_template_for_advanced_T&E.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook walks through an advanced T&E example for an image classification task.
>
> 1. Define the T&E task
> 2. Set up the dataset
> 3. Load the classification model
> 4. Scope relevant attacks
> 5. Execute evaluation
> 6. Draw conclusions on model vulnerabilities
> 7. Next steps
>

## `4_get_started_adversarial_patch.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook demonstrates how to perform an adversarial patch attack on CIFAR-10 data and a simple classification model using HEART and MAITE
>
> **Intended Audience:** All T&E Users

## `5_get_started_object_detection.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook demonstrates how to perform object detection with DeTR using HEART and MAITE
>
> **Intended Audience:** All T&E Users

## `6_adversarial_patch_for_object_detection.ipynb`

> **Description:** This notebook demonstrates how to perform adversarial patch attacks on object detection models using HEART and MAITE. For the purposes of this demonstration, DeTR will be the object detection model of choice and a variety of images from the COCO data set will be used for executing detection and attack.
