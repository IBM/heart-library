# Attack Cards

The attack cards below provide pertinent information on the adversarial attacks supported by HEART. While the world of Adversarial AI is wider than we can show here, we are including specifically the scope of Adversarial AI supported by HEART (with some references to ART's broader range of support).

Descriptions, metrics, scalability, and other information on the various attacks supported by HEART can be found in these Attack Cards. For more information, please see {doc}`HEART's Adversarial Evaluation Pathways <../evaluation_pathways>` .
