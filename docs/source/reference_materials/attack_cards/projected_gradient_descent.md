# Projected Gradient Descent

**Attack type:** white box, gradient-based, evasion, digital

**Best for:** models with continuous domain and high-dimensional input data such as images and videos are most vulnerable to PGD attacks, as there is more opportunity to find a combination of imperceptible perturbations that are successful.

**Attack summary:** PGD attacks produce adversarial perturbations (slight variations) in an image (or other approximately continuous domain) that are often difficult to detect with the naked eye. PGD attacks are white-box attacks, which means that they are only possible when the attacker has access to, and knowledge of, the model architecture, parameters and gradients. Gradient-based attacks exploit the knowledge of the modelâ€™s gradients to determine how slight changes in the input (pixels in the case of images) influences the output of the model (such as classification probabilities or object detections). These perturbations are carefully optimized to increase the likelihood that the input will be misclassified (or objects go undetected) without making significant changes to the overall image. Perturbations across features can be uniform, small and very hard to detect, which means that the attack runs a high risk of going undetected.

        - **Task:** Object detection or classification
        - **Modality:** HEART currently only supports images, ART supports images and video
        - **Data:** Single or three color channel images, of standardized dimensions. Specify pixels in range 0-1 or 0-255, matching input data
        - **Model:** Must be fully differentiable in order to compute gradients

    .. grid-item-card::  Getting started

        To get started with PGD attacks, see the :ref:`pgd-notebook-label` notebook, available `here <https://github.com/IBM/heart-library/blob/main/notebooks/1_get_started_pgd_attack.ipynb>`__.

        For increased relevance to your use case, replace the selected hugging face model with your own model, and the test data set with a test dataset of your own.

    .. grid-item-card::  Interpreting the results

        - **Adversarial perturbation size:** usually defined by the norm of the perturbation matrix
        - **Accuracy:** used to evaluate classification models (correct out of total)
        - **mAP (mean average precision):** used to evaluate object detection models (calculated difference between ground truth and prediction boxes)
        - evaluate test results at 3 levels:

          - **Clean:** standard

          - **Robust:** after adversarial attack on all samples

          - **Adversarial:** after adversarial attack on samples correctly predicted in non-adversarial scenario

    .. grid-item-card::  What could go wrong?


        - Model and input data not compatible --> see 'Compatibility considerations' above.

        - Model is overfit --> won't produce useful gradient information

        - Wrong hyperparameters --> iterations must be enough for attack to converge

        - Landed on false local minimum, no adversarial example present --> modify loss function

        - Model not differentiable or gradient direction doesn't minimize loss function --> loss function must be appropriate to model

        - *Last* sample of attack path returned, not adversarial --> have optimization algorithm return *best* attack path sample

        For more information on causes of attack failure, see Carlini's `Indicators of Attack Failure <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09947>`_ and Tramer's `On Adaptive Attacks to Adversarial Example Defenses <https://proceedings.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/11f38f8ecd71867b42433548d1078e38-Paper.pdf>`_.
